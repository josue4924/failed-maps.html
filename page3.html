    <h2> interest </h2>
    <li>soccer:my fondness of soccer began at a very young age. I joined my first soccer team when i was 6 years old. I would play every day with my dad and older siblings.once i grew up i stopped playing every day then i became to busy and now i rarely play it even though i still enjoy it.
    <li>cars:my interest in cars began when i began to drive very frequently. plus my dad is a manager at a car part com[pany so he was already addicted to cars. but now im into the interior of the cars for example switching the exhaust to make the car louder when it runs and things like that.
    <li>sneakers: my love for sneakers was first a collection. so it was more like a hobby but then i started to realize how much money i can make reselling sneakers. so i did my research and started selling shoes which i highly profited from. it opepned up a new world for me aswell the sneaker culture is on the rise.
